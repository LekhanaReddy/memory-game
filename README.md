## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

1.  There are 8 pair of different cards.
2.  click on the cards at various places.
3.  If two cards are matched then card changes its colour and if not matched cards closes.
4.  When we are playing the game timer displays and stars will be decreased after certain number of moves.
5.  If we click on reload button then the game `restarts` from the beginning.
6.  game ends if all cards are matched .
7.  When game ends it displays the message like `congrats` & you won the game along with the time taken, number of stars and moves.
8.  After completion it shows an OK button, if we click on that the game should restart.
